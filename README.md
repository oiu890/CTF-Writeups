## How to navigate
Folders are named after the CTF, and the corresponding year.  
Each CTF has a file called CTFNAME.md where I give a short description of how the CTF went.    
Writeups for challenges can be found in their respective folders, within the category that they fall under. It will be named as CHALLNAME.md.
